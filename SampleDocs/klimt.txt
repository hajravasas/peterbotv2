Gustav Klimt (1862-1918) was an Austrian symbolist painter and one of the most prominent figures of the Vienna Secession movement. He was born on July 14, 1862, in Baumgarten, near Vienna, Austria. Klimt showed artistic talent from an early age and attended the Vienna School of Arts and Crafts, where he received formal training in painting and architectural decoration.

In the early years of his career, Klimt, along with his brother Ernst and a friend, Franz Matsch, formed a successful artistic partnership known as the "Company of Artists." They received numerous commissions for public murals and decorations, which helped Klimt gain recognition and financial stability.

As he matured as an artist, Klimt's style evolved, and he became associated with the Symbolist movement. His works often featured elaborate and intricate patterns, rich colors, and symbolism, exploring themes of sensuality, love, and the human psyche. He was particularly known for his portrayals of women, often depicted in luxurious and ornate surroundings.

In 1897, Klimt co-founded the Vienna Secession, a group of artists who aimed to break away from traditional academic art and embrace a more modern and progressive approach. The group held exhibitions and published a magazine called "Ver Sacrum," promoting their ideas and showcasing their artworks.

One of Klimt's most famous works is "The Kiss," painted between 1907 and 1908, which exemplifies his symbolic and decorative style. This painting depicts a couple embraced in an intimate kiss and has become an iconic representation of love and romance in art history.

Throughout his career, Klimt faced both praise and controversy for his bold and provocative artistic choices. His works often sparked public debate due to their sensuality and use of nudity. Nevertheless, he remained dedicated to his artistic vision and continued to create a diverse range of artworks, including portraits, landscapes, and allegorical pieces.

Tragically, Klimt's life was cut short when he succumbed to a stroke on February 6, 1918, at the age of 55. Despite his premature death, his legacy continued to influence later generations of artists, and his contributions to the development of modern art remain celebrated and admired to this day.
