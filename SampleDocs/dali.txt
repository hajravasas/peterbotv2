Salvador Dalí (1904-1989) was a Spanish surrealist painter known for his eccentric personality, flamboyant style, and bizarre, dreamlike imagery. He was born on May 11, 1904, in Figueres, Catalonia, Spain. From a young age, Dalí displayed artistic talent and went on to study at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Madrid.

In his early career, Dalí experimented with various artistic styles, including Cubism and Impressionism. However, it was his association with the Surrealist movement that brought him international fame. Dalí officially joined the Surrealists in the 1920s, and his works from this period often featured strange and irrational scenes, melting watches, and distorted figures.

One of Dalí's most famous paintings is "The Persistence of Memory" (1931), featuring the iconic melting clocks draped over various objects. This work became a symbol of Surrealism and is one of the most recognized paintings in art history.

Dalí was known for his theatrical and attention-grabbing behavior, often sporting a flamboyant mustache and eccentric clothing. He was a master of self-promotion and used his public persona to gain notoriety and support for his art.

Throughout his career, Dalí continued to explore new artistic techniques and mediums, including sculpture, film, and photography. He collaborated with filmmakers, creating surreal and provocative short films such as "Un Chien Andalou" and "L'Age d'Or" with Luis Buñuel.

In 1940, Dalí and his wife, Gala, moved to the United States to escape the turmoil of World War II in Europe. He continued to create art during this period and gained popularity in the American art scene. However, his relationship with the Surrealist movement became strained, leading to his eventual expulsion from the group.

Dalí's later works explored themes of science, religion, and mysticism, and he embraced a more classical style in contrast to his earlier Surrealist phase. He referred to this later period as his "Nuclear Mysticism" phase.

Salvador Dalí passed away on January 23, 1989, in Figueres, Spain. His legacy remains enduring, and he is remembered not only as a highly talented artist but also as an enigmatic and influential figure in the art world. Dalí's contributions to Surrealism and his unique artistic vision continue to captivate and inspire artists and art enthusiasts around the globe.
